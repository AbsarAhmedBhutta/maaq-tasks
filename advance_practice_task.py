# Lists:
#
# Implement a function to reverse a list in-place without using any built-in methods.
# Write a function to find the kth smallest element in a list using a quickselect algorithm.
# Create a list comprehension that filters out duplicates from a given list while preserving the original order.
# Implement a merge sort algorithm to sort a list in ascending order.
# Write a function that finds the longest increasing subsequence in a list and returns its length.
# Tuples:
#
# Create a tuple of coordinates representing points in a 2D space, and implement a function to find the closest pair
# of points. Write a program that takes multiple tuples as input and sorts them based on a specific element within
# each tuple. Create a function that accepts a tuple of integers and returns a new tuple with the elements reversed.
# Implement a function that finds the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in a tuple of integers. Write a program
# that computes the dot product of two tuples representing vectors. Sets:
#
# Create a program that finds the union, intersection, and difference of two sets.
# Implement a function that checks whether a set is a subset of another set.
# Write a program to find the symmetric difference between two sets.
# Create a function that calculates the Jaccard similarity coefficient between two sets.
# Implement a set-based solution to solve the classic "N-Queens" problem.
# Dictionaries:
#
# Write a function that merges two dictionaries, combining the values of common keys.
# Implement a program that finds the key with the highest value in a dictionary.
# Create a function that counts the frequency of each word in a given sentence using a dictionary.
# Write a program that checks if two dictionaries have the same keys but potentially different values.
# Implement a dictionary-based cache that stores the results of expensive function calls and retrieves them when needed.
